Homework 4 Problem 5 Review\\
Reviewed by Jacob Shiohira
\end{center}

\subsection*{Problem 5a}
\begin{enumerate}
\item I got a little confused on the step where you jump to $\abs{x-2} < \frac{\epsilon}{4}$, for $1<x<3$. I think you took $\frac{\epsilon}{\abs{x+1}}$ and plugged in $3$ for $x$, but it might be helpful if you explicitly state what you are doing.
\item For the last part, I'm not sure that your steps are in the right order. I may be wrong but in class, we said "Let $\delta_\epsilon=$ something.  Then $0<x<\delta_\epsilon$..." Then we showed how $-\epsilon_\delta<x<\delta_\epsilon$ led to $-\epsilon<f(x)<\epsilon$. Thus, $\abs{f(x)} < \epsilon$. What you have may be fine, but I just noticed it was a little different than what we did in class.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Problem 5b}
\begin{enumerate}
\item I like that you went through the process of actually taking the derivative of $sin(x)+cos(x)$ to show the maximum.
\item Mayb say something about the fact that $\sqrt{2}$ being the max value of $sin(x)+cos(x)$ that it is an upper bound and if we can prove $x^2\sqrt{2} < \epsilon$, we know that $x^2(sin(x)+cos(x)) < \epsilon$ as well.
\item Same as the proof part on $5a$.
\end{enumerate}
